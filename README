Prototype of a web-based pokerdemo client.

Uses blockly for pure client-side blocks.


TODO:
- prolog output of card_ blocks
- correct prolog output; no nested math, but raise(5+3) -> raise(X1), X1 is 5+3
- connect to a table (using http request: https://github.com/Dtai/Webserver/blob/master/server/joinTable.php)
- send rules to a table (same as above)
- add all missing blocks that are in other client
