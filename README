Prototype of a web-based pokerdemo client.

Uses blockly for pure client-side blocks.


TODO:
- equivalent of CardEquation
    perhaps: pkr_cardin:   <pkr_cardval> in <pkr_cardset>
             pkr_cardsuit: <pkr_cardin|pkr_cardset> have suit equal to [hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades, same suit]
             pkr_cardval:  <pkr_cardin|pkr_cardset> have value [=,!=,<,<=,>,>=] <int>
             pkr_cardval:  <pkr_cardin|pkr_cardset> have [equal value,increasing values]
             pkr_cardsel:  any <int> card(s)
             pkr_cardset:  all [table cards, hand cards, table and hand cards]
- correct prolog output; no nested math, but raise(5+3) -> raise(X1), X1 is 5+3
- connect to a table (using http request: https://github.com/Dtai/Webserver/blob/master/server/joinTable.php)
- send rules to a table (same as above)
- add all missing blocks that are in other client
