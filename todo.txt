  - Solution should be click to zoom.
        // Can't find a nice way to do this...
        // Customize this with Semantic-ui dimmer?

  - Add legends to the different graphs.
  - Automatically assign seats when table is created.
  - Add title to the top graph.
  - Calculation time as bottom graph in the side bar.
  - Change the order of the blocks based on the 'popularity'.

// Future?:

Ideas:
- Uploading BLOCKLY code to preview others? (db?)
- More Stepwise Client Side
