Extra's:
  - Check browser: Redirect if unsupported?
  - Exact footer text?
  - Switch to Group A, B, C, ...
  - More than 2 cards in cardholder when selected 'hand'...
  - Link to ranks.
  - Update win checker description.
  - Add second solution to the >10 >A order solution.
  - Remove extra 'true' from prolog.

Server-side Todo's:
  - Translate Server-side errors.
  - Catch 'invalid prolog' on server.
  - Rolling average in bar charts should be faster.
  - A lot of input checks should still be done on the server.
  - Find some bottlenecks on server?
  - Change the log location.
  - Fetch JSON error in case of incorrect actions.

Future ideas:
  - Upload blocks for preview?
  - Possibility to load bots in multiplayer tables?
  - Lock & unlock tables.

Notes on mail:
  - Raise, Fold & Call should not be translated.
  - It should be clear now the the tutorial dropdown contains 'chapters'.
  - Groups is something that can be fixed (ABC), but was clear during tests...
  - Copy paste controls are OS specific.
  - Order of blocks is fine I think, cards are more important?
  - Don't understand the banner idea.
