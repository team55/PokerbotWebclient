Todo's (should be finished on 20/07):
  - Fix issue with bottom graphs when new player sits down.
  - Choose some cooler colors!
  - Fix load block issue or just for debug purposes?

Notes for demo:

  BLOCKLY
  - Design of BLOCKLY is pretty ugly, but couldn't find a decent color palette
    for now. Should still be updated in the future.

  CREATE TABLES / SIGN IN
  - Double check password? Making a mistake is possible for now.
  - There is no error if the table already exists...
  - Loading icon when signing in... Can take a while.
  - For now, table selection is done with an input box but would be cooler with
    a dropdown. In order to implement this, we need to fix the backend API.

  GRAPHS
  - Fixed a rounding issue... Had too much detail!
  - What is the basic rule? Weird for first graph...

  GENERAL
  - Errors should be written in Dutch (server-side).
  - We can't see our rules atm. We can save these client side?

  ISSUES
  - When focus is on an input box, border-radius magically disappears?


// OLD:

Todo's (ideas)

REGULAR CLIENT
- Switch to a JSON API                                          x
- More logging on Client Side (Connections and code)            x
- Uploading BLOCKLY code to preview others? (db?)
- More Stepwise Client Side                                     x
- Layout of client site                                         x
- Layout of different graphs
    (stay in another view, should be loaded on multiple locs)
- Disconnect button                                             x

ADMIN CLIENT
- Password? Anyone can spam new tables...
- Possibility to open new tables (custom size)
- Load bots into the tables
- Preconfigured in a list
- Lock tables (hide tables) and unlock tables

Extra's
- Explanation of the graphs

irl: box, expanation video, etc;

Today (Start?):
    - JSON API, check input, etc. Stable & secure!
    - JS instance for easy use of the API.
    - Some documentation for better overview.
    - Client side AngularJS?
    - Add some high level logging on the client side (API & Code).
    - Layout of the client side page, with view for stats.
    - Disconnect button!

NOTES:
    Should the 1-1 table be automatically created by user or admin?


Design notes:

STEP 1, TUTORIAL

  1.  Callbot en if statement uitleggen
      Make a high card (with examples)
  2.  Make a pair, variables uitleggen
  3.  #Raises om te limiteren
  4. volgorde van statements, evt me de 3 of a kind
  5. defeat bot



1. Create all tables API.
2. Connect to the new UI.
    - Dropdown instead of input-box.
