SKYPE:
  - Add legend to charts on side and bottom (how?).
  - Top chart can be in labels or ranks.
  - Fix bar loading margin.

Todo's after first test:
  - Hide Step5 tables in UI.
  - Too much text.
  - Default action is fold! (wasn't obvious).
  - Clear workspace button.
  - Make translation better!
  - Make toolbox buttons more feel like buttons.

Server-side Todo's:
  - Add server side error when table already exists.
  - Translate Server-side errors.
  - Catch 'invalid prolog' error server side.
  - Find some bottlenecks on server?
  - A lot of desanitizing should still be done.
  - Rolling average in bar charts should be faster.

// Future?:

Ideas:
- Uploading BLOCKLY code to preview others? (db?)
- More Stepwise Client Side
- Load bots into the tables
- Preconfigured in a list (the default bots)
- Lock tables (hide tables) and unlock tables
- Explanation of the graphs
