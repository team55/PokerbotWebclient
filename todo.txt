Notes:
  CROSS-ORIGIN ISSUE:
    - Should be fixed when it runs on the server.
    - Local website runs in Safari tho.
    - We can't set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header on server for
      security purposes. We should make it easy to deploy on the server.

Todo's:
  - If you copy a block, then remove it, blockly crashes (blockly issue).
  - Add legends to the different graphs.

Server-side Todo's:
  - Add server side error when table already exists.
  - Translate Server-side errors.
  - Catch 'invalid prolog' error server side.
  - Find some bottlenecks on server?

// Future?:

Ideas:
- Uploading BLOCKLY code to preview others? (db?)
- More Stepwise Client Side
- Load bots into the tables
- Preconfigured in a list (the default bots)
- Lock tables (hide tables) and unlock tables
- Explanation of the graphs
