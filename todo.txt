Final todos for beta:
  GLOBAL:
    - Clean project.
    - Test on 127.0.0.1 before beta push.
  MAIN GAME:
    - Disconnect button is fine, but add second one (instead of disabled one).
    - See if a transition is needed?
  TUTORIAL:
    - Add 'default action is fold' to the tutorial.
    - Fix the Bot step 'next' buttons (border-radius).

Server-side Todo's:
  - Translate Server-side errors.
  - Catch 'invalid prolog' on server.
  - Rolling average in bar charts should be faster.
  - Add server side error when table already exists.
  - A lot of input checks should still be done on the server.
  - Find some bottlenecks on server?

Future ideas:
  - Upload blocks for preview?
  - Possibility to load bots in multiplayer tables?
  - Lock & unlock tables.

Notes on mail:
  - Raise, Fold & Call should not be translated.
  - It should be clear now the the tutorial dropdown contains 'chapters'.
  - Groups is something that can be fixed (ABC), but was clear during tests...
  - Copy paste controls are OS specific.
  - Order of blocks is fine I think, cards are more important?
  - Don't understand the banner idea.
