Todo's (should be finished on 20/07):
  - Add side charts
  - Add bottom charts
  - Fix legend issue
  - Fix load block issue or just for debug purposes?
  - Display warnings in case of overhead.

Notes:
  - For now, table selection is done with an input box but would be cooler with
    a dropdown. In order to implement this, we need to fix the backend API.
  - When focus is on an input box, border-radius magically disappears?
  - Errors should be written in dutch (server-side).
  - Loading icon when signing in... Can take a while.
  - We can't see our rules atm. We can save these client side?


// OLD:

Todo's (ideas)

REGULAR CLIENT
- Switch to a JSON API                                          x
- More logging on Client Side (Connections and code)            x
- Uploading BLOCKLY code to preview others? (db?)
- More Stepwise Client Side                                     x
- Layout of client site                                         x
- Layout of different graphs
    (stay in another view, should be loaded on multiple locs)
- Disconnect button                                             x

ADMIN CLIENT
- Password? Anyone can spam new tables...
- Possibility to open new tables (custom size)
- Load bots into the tables
- Preconfigured in a list
- Lock tables (hide tables) and unlock tables

Extra's
- Explanation of the graphs

irl: box, expanation video, etc;

Today (Start?):
    - JSON API, check input, etc. Stable & secure!
    - JS instance for easy use of the API.
    - Some documentation for better overview.
    - Client side AngularJS?
    - Add some high level logging on the client side (API & Code).
    - Layout of the client side page, with view for stats.
    - Disconnect button!

NOTES:
    Should the 1-1 table be automatically created by user or admin?


Design notes:

  1.  Callbot en if statement uitleggen
      Make a high card (with examples)
  2.  Make a pair, variables uitleggen
  3.  #Raises om te limiteren
  4. volgorde van statements, evt me de 3 of a kind
  5. defeat bot



1. Create all tables API.
2. Connect to the new UI.
    - Dropdown instead of input-box.
