Notes:
  CROSS-ORIGIN ISSUE:
    - Should be fixed when it runs on the server.
    - Local website runs in Safari tho.
    - We can't set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header on server for
      security purposes. We should make it easy to deploy on the server.
  TOP CHART:
    - No range, but we can add the values to the legend. This might
      be a nicer way to display concrete values.
  SIDE CHARTS:
    - No idea how to display extra legend. Is too crowded, I think we should
      fix it by just using tooltips.

Todo's:
  - Fix smaller labels in bargraph.
  - Add legend to bargraph.
  - Auto hide bottom on default.
  - Fix 'Activate Rule' button margin on fullscreen.
  - Remove save and load buttons (comment).
  - Shorten long names.

Server-side Todo's:
  - Add server side error when table already exists.
  - Translate Server-side errors.
  - Catch 'invalid prolog' error server side.
  - Find some bottlenecks on server?
  - A lot of desanitizing should still be done.

// Future?:

Ideas:
- Uploading BLOCKLY code to preview others? (db?)
- More Stepwise Client Side
- Load bots into the tables
- Preconfigured in a list (the default bots)
- Lock tables (hide tables) and unlock tables
- Explanation of the graphs
